Dan Drennan final project for STAT647: Spatial Statistics taught in
Fall 2022 at Texas A&M University College Station. The project
summarizes the work in Kidd and Katzfuss (2022; Bayesian Analysis)
and Katzfuss and Schafer (2021; arXiv:21.08.04211v4). Specifically,
it is an overview of estimating second order nonstationary spatial
processes on regular grids using nonparametric Bayesian methods.
